The balanced braces problem, also known as the balanced parentheses problem, is a common coding interview problem that involves checking whether a given string of braces, parentheses, or brackets is properly balanced. In other words, the problem is to determine whether the opening and closing symbols in the string are correctly paired and arranged in a valid and balanced manner.

Problem Statement:

You are given a string containing various types of braces, such as parentheses '()', square brackets '[]', and curly braces '{}'. Your task is to determine whether the braces in the string are balanced or not. A string is considered balanced if the following conditions are met:

For every opening brace, there must be a corresponding closing brace of the same type, and they must be properly nested within each other.
The braces must be closed in the correct order; you cannot close a brace before closing its inner braces.
Examples:

Here are some examples to illustrate the concept of balanced and unbalanced strings:

Balanced String: "()" - The opening and closing parentheses match, so it's balanced.
Unbalanced String: "(" - There's an opening parenthesis without a matching closing parenthesis, so it's unbalanced.
Balanced String: "([]{})" - All types of braces are properly nested and closed in the correct order, so it's balanced.
Unbalanced String: "({[)]}" - While it contains both opening and closing braces of each type, the order of closing is incorrect, so it's unbalanced.
Approach:

The common approach to solving this problem is to use a stack data structure. You iterate through the characters in the string from left to right, and for each opening brace, you push it onto the stack. When you encounter a closing brace, you pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing brace. If they match, you continue processing the string; if they don't match, or if you encounter a closing brace without a corresponding opening brace in the stack, the string is considered unbalanced.

The problem can be solved efficiently using a stack, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

The balanced braces problem is often used in coding interviews to assess a candidate's ability to handle data structures like stacks and write code that correctly analyzes and manipulates strings.
