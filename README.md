# InterviewPractice
This repository will contain practice interview problems that I've done, and their solutions for reference in the future.

To maintain the solutions, I've used PyTest. To run tests, use `python -m pytest`.

# Disclaimer
**I DO NOT CLAIM THESE AS THE BEST SOLUTIONS, OR EVEN THAT THEY WILL WORK FOR EVERY INPUT. ONLY THAT THEY PASS WITH THE INPUT DATA I HAVE**

If anyone reviews this code and has a better solution, I welcome comments on the code. Also, I'd like to welcome other solutions. If you have another method
for solving a problem listed in the table below, or if you have a solution in a language not found in this repository, feel free to create a pull request adding that solution.
